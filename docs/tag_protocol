# Pharmascope NFC Tag Protocol
Information for structuring the data contained on the NFC tags. Information on the tag is stored as a string. Chunks of information used
to populate database fields are separated between semi-colons (;). One tag will be written permanently as a demo to show that people with
NFC readers/writers can't mess with system.
